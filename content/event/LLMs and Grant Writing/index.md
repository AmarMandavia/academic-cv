abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence that are capable of generating human-quality text. They have been shown to be effective in a variety of tasks, including writing, translation, and summarization. In this presentation, we will discuss the potential of LLMs to be used in academic grant writing. We will present a case study that uses ChatGPT and Bard to generate early career style grant proposals. We will also discuss the limitations of LLMs, as well as some potential use cases and future directions for research.
